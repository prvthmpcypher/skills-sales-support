name: churn-analyst
description: Analyzes customer churn data to identify patterns and leading indicators, and proposes specific retention interventions targeted at the actual drivers found. Use this whenever the user has churn data to review, asks "why are customers leaving", wants help identifying at-risk accounts before they churn, needs a churn analysis for a board/investor update, or wants to design a retention/win-back campaign grounded in actual churn patterns rather than generic tactics.

# Churn Analyst

Generic retention tactics (discount offers, "we miss you" emails) underperform because they treat all churn as the same problem. Real churn analysis segments by *why* customers left, since the fix for "never onboarded successfully" is completely different from "found a cheaper competitor" or "outgrew the product."

## Workflow

1. **Get the data**: churn events with timestamps, and ideally account attributes (plan tier, tenure, usage/engagement metrics, support ticket history) alongside them. Read attached data directly rather than asking the user to describe it.
2. **Segment churn by tenure first.** Early churn (within the first 30-90 days, roughly) almost always indicates an onboarding/activation problem — the customer never reached the point of experiencing real value. Late churn (established, engaged accounts leaving) indicates a different problem — competitive pressure, changing needs, or a specific negative experience. Don't propose the same fix for both.
3. **Look for leading indicators before the churn event itself** — declining usage/login frequency, a drop in a key engagement metric, a support ticket that went unresolved, a missed renewal conversation. These are what make churn *predictable* rather than only explainable after the fact, and they're what a retention intervention should actually trigger on.
4. **Correlate churn rate against account attributes** — plan tier, acquisition channel, company size/segment — to find which sub-populations churn at meaningfully different rates. A blended overall churn rate often hides a specific segment driving most of the problem.
5. **Distinguish voluntary from involuntary churn** (e.g. failed payment/card expiration vs. an active decision to cancel) — involuntary churn has a completely different, often much simpler fix (better payment retry logic, proactive card-expiration outreach) than voluntary churn does, and conflating the two understates how fixable a chunk of "churn" actually is.
6. **Propose interventions tied to the specific driver found**, not a generic playbook — e.g. if early churn correlates with never completing a specific onboarding step, the intervention is fixing that step or adding a nudge at that point, not a blanket "improve onboarding" recommendation.

## What NOT to do

- Don't recommend a discount/win-back offer as the default fix without first identifying whether price was actually the churn driver — offering a discount to someone who left because the product didn't fit their need doesn't address anything and trains customers to churn strategically for discounts.
- Don't report a single blended churn rate as the whole finding — always segment, since the aggregate number usually obscures the more useful and actionable pattern.
- Don't manufacture a root cause the data doesn't support — if the data doesn't clearly point to a driver, say so and recommend what additional data (e.g. exit surveys, a support ticket audit) would help isolate it.

## Output format

## Churn analysis: <period>

**Overall churn rate:** [with voluntary/involuntary split if determinable]

**Segments found:**
| Segment | Churn rate | Likely driver | Evidence |

**Leading indicators identified:** [what predicts churn before it happens, if found]

**Recommended interventions:** [tied specifically to the drivers above, ranked by likely impact]
